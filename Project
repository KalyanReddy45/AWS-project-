Here’s a simplified AWS-only project:

### **Project Title: Automating and Securing a Scalable Web Application on AWS**

#### **Project Overview:**
This project involves deploying a scalable web application on AWS, automating the deployment process, implementing monitoring, and ensuring security—all using AWS services only.

#### **Steps Involved:**

1. **Deploy the Web Application:**
   - **EC2 Instance**: Launch an EC2 instance to host your web application (e.g., a simple Node.js or PHP application).
   - **Auto Scaling**: Set up an Auto Scaling Group to automatically scale the number of EC2 instances based on traffic demands.
   - **Load Balancer**: Use an Elastic Load Balancer (ELB) to distribute incoming traffic across the EC2 instances for better availability.

2. **Automate Infrastructure Setup:**
   - **CloudFormation**: Use AWS CloudFormation to define your infrastructure as code. Write a CloudFormation template to automatically provision the EC2 instances, Auto Scaling Group, and Load Balancer.

3. **Configure Storage:**
   - **RDS**: Set up an RDS instance to handle the database for your application.
   - **S3**: Use S3 for static content storage (e.g., images, CSS files) and configure it to serve content via CloudFront for faster delivery.

4. **Implement Security Best Practices:**
   - **Security Groups**: Set up security groups to control inbound and outbound traffic for your EC2 instances.
   - **IAM Roles**: Create IAM roles with the least privilege access to secure your resources.
   - **SSL/TLS**: Use AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to manage SSL/TLS certificates for your web application.

5. **Monitoring and Logging:**
   - **CloudWatch**: Set up CloudWatch to monitor the performance of your EC2 instances and RDS databases. Create alarms for critical metrics like CPU utilization.
   - **CloudTrail**: Enable CloudTrail to log all API activity across your AWS account for auditing and compliance.

6. **Automate Backups:**
   - **RDS Backups**: Configure automated backups for your RDS instance to ensure data protection.
   - **S3 Versioning**: Enable versioning on your S3 buckets to protect against accidental deletions.

7. **Deploy and Maintain Application:**
   - **Elastic Beanstalk (Optional)**: For easier deployment, you can use AWS Elastic Beanstalk, which handles the scaling, load balancing, and health monitoring of your web application automatically.

#### **Expected Outcome:**
- A fully deployed and automated web application on AWS, with scalable infrastructure.
- Robust security and monitoring practices implemented using AWS services.
- Experience in using key AWS services for real-world cloud-based deployment scenarios.

This project is designed to give you hands-on experience with essential AWS services while ensuring that the entire deployment and management process is automated and secure, all within the free tier limits.
